## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10 or above**: Ensure Python is installed and added to your system's PATH.
- **ElevenLabs API Key**: [Sign up here](https://elevenlabs.io/) to create an account and obtain your API key.
  - This API key is required for generating speech and creating agents.
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized deployments.

### Installation

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thoughtscribe.git
cd thoughtscribe
```

#### 2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. **Set Up the `.env` File**
- In the project root, create a file named `.env`.
- Add the following variables to configure your ElevenLabs API key and optionally a default agent ID:
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here  # Optional
```
- If you donâ€™t already have an ElevenLabs API key, visit [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) to sign up and generate your key.

> **Important**: Do not share or commit the `.env` file to version control. Ensure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file to protect sensitive credentials.

### Dynamic Agent Creation
- If no agent is pre-configured, you can dynamically create one within the app by providing:
  - A valid API key.
  - An agent name.
  - Model preferences (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3.5).
  - Optional settings such as knowledge base files and system prompts.

### Running the App
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Access the App
- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## Secure Setup
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information like API keys in the `.env` file.
- **Avoid Sharing Credentials**: Never share or upload the `.env` file.
- **Remote Deployments**: Configure environment variables using your hosting provider's interface for additional security.
- **Encryption**: API keys are securely stored and handled within the application.
